# Online-Food-Ordering-Application
The JavaFX-based Online Food Ordering Application is a comprehensive project that utilizes Java programming concepts and frameworks to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform for ordering food online. The application employs JavaFX for building the graphical user interface (GUI), offering a visually appealing and interactive experience for users.

Key Implemented Features:

GUI Design: The application utilizes JavaFX to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, allowing customers to browse and select food items, customize their orders, and view restaurant information.

Socket Programming: Socket programming is employed to establish a connection between the client application and the server. It enables real-time communication and data exchange between the client and server components of the application.

Multithreading: Multithreading is utilized to enhance performance and responsiveness. The application employs multiple threads to handle concurrent tasks, such as fetching data from the server, processing orders, and updating the GUI without freezing the user interface.

Collection Framework: The project utilizes various data structures from the Java collection framework, such as HashMap, HashSet, and ArrayList, to manage and organize food items, customer orders, and restaurant information efficiently.

Generics: Generics are incorporated to ensure type safety and code reusability. Generic classes and methods are used to handle different data types dynamically, allowing for flexibility in managing food items, orders, and other relevant data.

Exception Handling: The application implements robust exception handling mechanisms to handle errors and exceptional scenarios gracefully. Proper exception handling ensures that the application remains stable and can recover from unexpected situations, such as network connectivity issues or server errors.

The JavaFX-based Online Food Ordering Application combines various Java programming concepts, including GUI design, socket programming, multithreading, collection framework usage, generics, and exception handling, to create a fully functional and user-friendly platform for ordering food online.
